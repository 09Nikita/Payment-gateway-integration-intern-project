                  <h2>Helps to provide financial support</h2>
                  <p>The Kerala flood was a calamity of severe nature which claimed many lives and displaced lakhs of people. Many people who lost their homes, farms and cattle were left without any source of income. The worst hit were underprivileged people from Central Kerala. To help them tide over, as a 1st Phase of intervention , IDEA Foundation too started a project to help affected schools and affected children. Some of the schools we have selected were supported for Benches & desks, Play materials , UPS for Computer lab, Science Lab equipment and provision for drinking water etc. Children in some of these schools were supported for School bag and study material , Study table & Chair based on the need assessment . In the second phase , some more schools were provided with drinking water facilities - storage / motor for pumping water to storage water tank .

                  <h2>Provides food,clothes etc</h2>
                  <p>Though help is coming from different corners of the world, the rebuilding work has to go a long way , especially in the form of family assistance . Families are in acute poverty as they lost their crops, agriculture tools, fishing boat , net , livestock and small shops . Families also need support to meet the educational needs of children mainly as school / coaching class fees. Currently based on the availability of funds , IDEA is supporting affected families for livelihood and to meet educational needs of the children in extremely poor families.

                  <h2>We take care about your protection</h2>
                  <p>The project is being undertaken as part of the rehabilitation program in the 2018 flood affected areas of Kerala by IDEA Foundation in partnership with Give Foundation. The areas of intervention were Kuttadu and Pandadu in central Kerala.The project period was from 1st September 2018 to 20th December 2018. As soon as the schools reopened after the flood, IDEA representatives visited a few schools in the most affected regions and after a need assessment, decided to focus on Kuttad & Pandad schools in Alleppy & Pathamthitta districts in Kerala.
